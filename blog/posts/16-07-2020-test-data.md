It is oftentimes desirable to DRY up our scripts by factoring out test data. In the case of simpler tests, it is normally not an issue to embed test data directly inside our script. Complex end-to-end scenarios might require us to move this information elsewhere, like a dedicated file.

Looking at our [test webshop](https://danube-store.herokuapp.com/), we might want to verify that a certain list of items is being loaded to the store's front page. As this list contains several tens of elements, each with different attributes, keeping our test data inside our script would be impractical. Let us instead add this to a JSON file instead:

```json
[
    { "title": "Haben oder haben", "author": "Fric Eromm", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "Parry Hotter", "author": "J/K Rowlin'", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "Laughterhouse-Five", "author": "Truk Tugennov", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "To Mock a Killingbird", "author": "Larper Hee", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "1498", "author": "Gorge Norwell", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "The Grand Grotsby", "author": "Gerald F. Scott", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "The Pickled Lynx", "author": "Ant One", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "Celsius 233", "author": "Bay Radbdury", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "The Rye in the Catcher", "author": "DJ Salinger", "price": "9.95" },
    { "title": "Of Mouse and Man", "author": "Johannes Beckstein", "price": "9.95" },
    ...
]
```

We are then able to feed this file into our test...

```js
const fs = require('fs')

...

let rawdata = fs.readFileSync('books.json')
const bookList = JSON.parse(rawdata)
const foundList = bookList
```

...and have each comparison executed to ensure the right elements are being shown.

```js
  // remove every element found from the control array...
  for  (i = 0; i < resultsNumber; i++) {
      const bookTitle = await page.$eval(`.preview:nth-child(${i+1}) > .preview-title`, e => e.innerText)
      const bookAuthor = await page.$eval(`.preview:nth-child(${i+1}) > .preview-author`, e => e.innerText)

      foundList = foundList.filter(e => (!((e.title === bookTitle) && (e.author === bookAuthor))))
  }
  
  // ...then assert that the control array is now empty
  assert.equal(foundList.length, 0)
```

In case the platform you are testing exposes an API endpoint to pull up-to-date test data, you could fetch the file as part of the setup phase of your test and then utilise it:

```js
const axios = require('axios')

...

const { data } = await axios.get('https://danube-store.herokuapp.com/api/books')

const bookList = JSON.parse(data)
const foundList = bookList
```
