## Editorial workflow

The maintainers of this repo will review your contribution. During a review we will check for:

- Relevance: is this topic interesting? Did we already cover it?
- Writing: any typos? Any flow errors? Is the reading understandable?
- Correctness: are the examples and code correct? 

The maintainer reserve the right to not merge your PR if we find it does not meet the standards we like to set for the community.
We will work with you, provide feedback and learn together: but we still might not merge.
