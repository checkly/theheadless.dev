Log in to your Microsoft Live account

# Steps

1. We start at https://login.live.com/
4. We provide the username and password, injected by using environment variables.
5. We are redirected to the main account page

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab Puppeteer 
<<< @/blog/snippets/puppeteer/mslive-login.js
:::

::: tab Playwright
<<< @/blog/snippets/playwright/mslive-login.js
:::

::::

Run this example as follows. Replace the username and password placeholder with your own credentials.

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab MacOS
```shell script
MSLIVE_USER=username MSLIVE_PWD=password node mslive-login.js
```
:::
::: tab Windows
```shell script
SET MSLIVE_USER=username
SET MSLIVE_PWD=password
node mslive-login.js
```
